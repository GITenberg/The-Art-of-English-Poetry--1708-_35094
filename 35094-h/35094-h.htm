<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION"></a>INTRODUCTION</h2>


<p>The <i>Art of English Poetry</i> (1702) may be roughly described as an
English version of the <i>Gradus ad Parnassum</i>. At least that is the
tradition to which it belongs. Its immediate predecessor was the
pleasant <i>English Parnassus: Or, a Helpe to English Poesie</i> (1657)
compiled by a Middlesex schoolmaster named Joshua Poole, and this work
was avowedly modeled on Ravisius Textor's <i>Epitheta</i> and the <i>Thesaurus
Poeticus</i> of Joannes Buchler. But whereas the <i>English Parnassus</i> was
designed for the schoolroom, the <i>Art of English Poetry</i> was designed
for the world of polite letters, and so may be called the first example
in English of the handbook for the serious poet.</p>

<p>In its original form the work was an octavo of nearly four hundred pages
divided into three parts: "Rules For making English Verse," a rhyming
dictionary, and a poetical commonplace book containing all the "Most
Natural, Agreeable, and Noble <i>Thoughts</i>" of the English poets digested
alphabetically by their subject. Only the first part is reproduced here,
but it seems desirable to say something about the book as a whole.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>It is one of those works which is scorned by all, and used by all who
scorn it. In the sixty years after its publication it went through nine
editions, and though Charles Gildon thought it "a book too scandalously
mean to name," he was constrained to admit that it had "spread, by many
editions, thro' all <i>England</i>" and had "carried off so many Impressions,
as have made it with the ignorant, the <i>Standard</i> of Writing."<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Not
only with the ignorant. Pope knew and used the work, and likewise
Richardson, Fielding, Isaac Watts, Johnson, Goldsmith, Walpole, Blake,
Sir Walter Scott, Bulwer-Lytton, and many others. Indeed, it would be
safe to say that there was hardly a literary man in the eighteenth
century who was not familiar with it. If he used a rhyming dictionary,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii" id="Page_ii">[Pg ii]</a></span>
he used that in Bysshe, at least until 1775, when it was superseded by
John Walker's <i>Dictionary of the English Language</i>. And if he used a
poetical commonplace book, he used either Bysshe or one of the five
other works which were produced in imitation of Bysshe. "Quoi qu'ils en
disent," said the Abbé du Bos of a similar work in French, "ils ont tous
ce livre dans leur arrière cabinet."</p>

<p>The <i>Art of English Poetry</i> is dominated in every part by the concept of
the heroic poem. The rhyming dictionary, which was enlarged and improved
from that in Poole, contains only those words which "both for their
Sense and Sound are judg'd most proper for the Rhymes of Heroick
Poetry;"<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> and the quotations in the commonplace book are drawn chiefly
from the heroic poem and the heroic drama. In the last revised edition
(1718) the most frequently quoted authors were Lee (104 passages), Rowe
(116), Milton (117), Shakespeare (118), Blackmore (125), Otway (127),
Butler (140), Cowley (143), Pope (155), and Dryden (1,201). Dryden,
therefore, was the great exemplar of the heroic poet, and his <i>Aeneid</i>,
which was cited 493 times, was the great exemplar of the heroic poem.
Its meter, the heroic couplet, was for Bysshe the only serious poetic
instrument, all longer lines being used merely to vary and decorate it
and the shorter ones being fit only for masks and operas and Pindaric
odes. As for stanzas, the rhyme royal was not "follow'd" anymore,
Spenser's choice was "unlucky," and in general, as Cowley had said, "no
kind of Staff is proper for a Heroic Poem; as being all too
lirical...."<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>The "Rules For making English Verse," which is the most important part
of Bysshe's work, is the first attempt to treat English prosody in a
systematic and comprehensive way. As the title indicates, it is
prescriptive in tone, and it is strictly syllabic in what it
prescribes. The English verse line, according to Bysshe, consists of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii" id="Page_iii">[Pg iii]</a></span>
specified number of syllables, usually ten, but permissably from four to
twelve with double rhyme adding an uncounted syllable. A verse with an
extra or a missing syllable (as compared with the pattern established by
the rest of the poem) is either a faulty verse or, more properly, just a
verse of a different kind. There are no feet in English poetry.
Nevertheless, accent, which Bysshe apparently considered a variation in
pitch rather than in duration or loudness, is recognized, and its role
is clearly prescribed. It falls on the even syllables in verses whose
total number is even and on the odd syllables in verses whose odd number
is not due to double rhyme. This, of course, means duple time only, and
Bysshe recognizes no other. When he quotes Congreve's verse, "Apart let
me view then each Heavenly fair," he feels that the measure is somehow
disagreeable, but he does not notice that the accents fall other than he
had prescribed, and he apparently thinks that the line is distinguished
from heroic verse only in having eleven syllables instead of ten. This
is highly important because it shows that although the nomina basis of
his prosody is both accentual and syllabic, the latter element is really
its defining principle.</p>

<p>In a syllabic prosody it is clearly necessary to determine the number of
syllables in a word whenever that is doubtful and also, if convenient,
to provide ways of regulating that number by syncope and elision. A
large part of Bysshe's treatise, therefore, is concerned with this task,
and in order to understand this part it is necessary to realize that the
shortened forms which he recommends (<i>am'rous</i>, <i>ta'en</i>, and the like)
were not originally "poetic" in character. By his day some very few had
become slightly archaic and hence were usually restricted to poetry;
others existed side by side, in both prose and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[Pg iv]</a></span> poetic speech, with the
longer forms which at last superseded them; but the great majority
represent the regular colloquial idiom of the late seventeenth and early
eighteenth century. Bysshe wanted them used in poetry because he wanted
the language of poetry to conform to that of cultivated conversation and
prose and because he did not want the heroic line weakened by allowing
for syllables that were not there, or were there only to the eye.</p>

<p>Bysshe says that he extracted his rules from the practice of the best
poets, but this is not true. He extracted them almost entirely from the
<i>Quatre Traitez de Poësies, Latine, Françoise, Italienne, et Espagnole</i>
(1663) by Claude Lancelot, one of the Port Royal educators. From the
Italian, Spanish, and possibly the Latin sections of this work Bysshe
took his rules on the position of the caesura and a few other hints; but
from the French section, the "Breve Instruction sur les Regles de la
Poësie Françoise," he took almost his entire prosodical system. Indeed,
his "Rules" are simply a translation and adaptation of the "Breve
Instruction" with English examples replacing the French. The opening
sentence, for example, which contains the very heart of his doctrine,
reads: "The Structure of our Verses, whether Blank, or in Rhyme,
consists in a certain Number of Syllables; not in Feet compos'd of long
and short Syllables, as the Verses of the <i>Greeks</i> and <i>Romans</i>." And
the source: "La structure ne consiste qu'en vn certain nombre de
syllabes, &amp; non pas en pieds composez de syllabes longues &amp; breves,
comme les vers des Grecs &amp; des Romains."<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>Needless to say, this description is accurate when applied to French
verse, but it is not accurate when applied to English. The rhythm of
English verse consists in the regular recurrence of a unit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v">[Pg v]</a></span> whose exact
nature is variously conceived but which is easily identified by the
accent which signalizes it. In French, however, stress in connected
speech is too weak and uncertain to be made the basis of a satisfactory
rhythm and is replaced in this function by the verse unit itself. These
units are made equal by their having an equal number of syllables, and
their recurrence is signalized by the final pause, by rhyme, and by the
accentuation of the rhymed syllable. In each language there are, of
course, other subsidiary rhythms, but the basic rhythm is founded upon
the verse unit in French and upon a unit within the verse in English.
Clearly, a prosody which applied to one system could not apply to the
other, and to suppose that it did was Bysshe's sole but disastrous
mistake. He was not the first to make it. What prosody there had been
before him had hesitated uncertainly among three systems, the
quantitative, the accentual, and the syllabic, but Bysshe, by
formulating for the first time a complete and explicit <i>prosodia</i>,
confirmed it in the one it was already favoring, the syllabic system of
the French. Through him the mistake became irreparable for over a
hundred years, and thus his "Rules" have an importance which is far
beyond their merit. Critically, they are nothing; but historically, they
dominated the popular prosodic thought of the eighteenth century.</p>

<p>Their supremacy was finally ended in 1816 by the preface to
<i>Christabel</i>. There Coleridge wrote that the meter of the poem was not,
properly speaking, irregular, though it might seem so from its being
founded on "a new principle: namely, that of counting in each line the
accents, not the syllables."<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> Scholars have wondered what was "new"
about this, and the answer is that it was not new in English poetry, but
in English prosodical criticism it was new, for it was a departure from
Bysshe.</p>

<h2><a name="A_NOTE_ON_THE_TEXT" id="A_NOTE_ON_THE_TEXT"></a>A NOTE ON THE TEXT</h2>



<p>The nine editions of the <i>Art of English Poetry</i> were as follows: 1702,
1705, 1708, 1710, 1714, 1718, 1724, 1737, and 1762. Four of these&mdash;1705,
1708, 1710, and 1718&mdash;represent a revision of the preceding edition,
that of 1718 only in the matter of adding new passages to the
commonplace book. The last revised text of the "Rules," therefore, is
that of the fourth edition (1710), but since this differs from the third
only by the omission of one passage, which is of some interest, it
seemed best to reproduce the text of the third edition (1708). The
omitted passage is the last five lines, beginning "and therefore ...,"
of the second paragraph on page 22.</p>

<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a><i>The PREFACE.</i></h2>


<p>So many are the Qualifications, as well natural as acquir'd, that are
essentially requisite to the making of a good Poet, that 'tis in vain
for any Man to aim at a great Reputation on account of his Poetical
Performances, by barely following the Rules of others, and reducing
their Speculations into Practice. It may not be impossible indeed for
Men, even of indifferent Parts, by making Examples to the Rules
hereafter given, to compose Verses smooth, and well-sounding to the Ear;
yet if such Verses want strong Sense, Propriety and Elevation of
Thought, or Purity of Diction, they will be at best but what <i>Horace</i>
calls them, <i>Versus inopes rerum, nugæque canoræ</i>, and the Writers of
them not Poets, but versifying Scriblers. I pretend not therefore by the
following Sheets to teach a Man to be a Poet in spight of Fate and
Nature, but only to be of Help to the few who are born to be so, and
whom <i>audit vocatus Apollo</i>.</p>

<p>To this End I give in the first Place <i>Rules for making</i> English <i>Verse</i>:
And these Rules I have, according to the best of my Judgment,
endeavour'd to extract from the Practice, and to frame after the
Examples of the Poets that are most celebrated for a fluent and numerous
Turn of Verse.</p>

<p>Another Part of this Treatise, is a <i>Dictionary of Rhymes</i>: To which
having prefix'd a large Preface shewing the Method and Usefulness of it,
I shall trouble the Reader in this place no farther than to acquaint
him, that if it be as useful and acceptable to the Publick, as the
composing it was tedious and painful to me, I shall never repent me of
the Labour.</p>

<p>What I shall chiefly speak of here, is the largest Part of this
Treatise, which I call a <i>Collection of the most natural and sublime
Thoughts that are in the best</i> English <i>Poets</i>. And to be ingenuous in the
Discovery, this was the Part of it that principally induc'd me to
undertake the Whole: The Task was indeed laborious, but pleasing; and
the sole Praise I expected from it, was, that I made a judicious Choice
and proper Disposition of the Passages I extracted. A Mixture of so
many different Subjects, and such a Variety of Thoughts upon them, may
possibly not satisfy the Reader so well, as a Composition perfect in its
Kind on one intire Subject; but certainly it will divert and amuse him
better; for here is no Thread of Story, nor Connexion of one Part with
another, to keep his Mind intent, and constrain him to any Length of
Reading. I detain him therefore only to acquaint him, why it is made a
Part of this Book, and how Serviceable it may be to the main Design of
it.</p>

<p>Having drawn up Rules for making Verses, and a Dictionary of Rhymes,
which are the Mechanick Tools of a Poet; I came in the next Place to
consider, what other human Aid could be offer'd him; a Genius and
Judgment not being mine to give. Now I imagin'd that a Man might have
both these, and yet sometimes, for the sake of a Syllable or two more or
less, to give a Verse its true Measure, be at a stand for Epithets and
Synonymes, with which I have seen Books of this Nature in several
Languages plentifully furnish'd.</p>

<p>Now, tho' I have differ'd from them in Method, yet I am of Opinion this
Collection may serve to the same End, with equal Profit and greater
Pleasure to the Reader. For, what are Epithets, but Adjectives that
denote and express the Qualities of the Substantives to which they are
join'd? as <i>Purple</i>, <i>Rosie</i>, <i>Smiling</i>, <i>Dewy</i>, Morning: <i>Dim</i>,
<i>Gloomy</i>, <i>Silent</i>, Night. What Synonymes, but Words of a like
Signification? as <i>Fear</i>, <i>Dread</i>, <i>Terrour</i>, <i>Consternation</i>,
<i>Affright</i>, <i>Dismay</i>, &amp;c. Are they not then naturally to be sought for
in the Descriptions of Persons and Things? And can we not better judge
by a Piece of Painting, how Beautifully Colours may be dispos'd; than by
seeing the same several Colours scatter'd without Design on a Table?
When you are at a Loss therefore for proper Epithets or Synonymes, look
in this Alphabetical Collection for any Word under which the Subject of
your Thought may most probably be rang'd; and you will find what have
been imploy'd by our best Writers, and in what Manner.</p>

<p>It would have
been as easie a Task for me as it has been to others before me, to have
threaded tedious Bead-rolls of Synonymes and Epithets together, and put
them by themselves: But when they stand alone, they appear bald,
insipid, uncouth, and offensive both to the Eye and Ear. In that
Disposition they may indeed help the Memory, but cannot direct the
Judgment in the Choice.</p>

<p>But besides, to confess a Secret, I am very unwilling it should be laid
to my Charge, that I have furnish'd Tools, and given a Temptation of
Versifying, to such as in spight of Art and Nature undertake to be
Poets; and who mistake their Fondness to Rhyme, or Necessity of Writing,
for a true Genius of Poetry, and lawful Call from <i>Apollo</i>. Such
Debasers of Rhyme and Dablers in Poetry would do well to consider, that
a Man would justly deserve a higher Esteem in the World by being a good
Mason or Shoo-maker, or by excelling in any other Art that his Talent
inclines him to, and that is useful to Mankind, than by being an
indifferent or second-Rate Poet. Such have no Claim to that Divine
Appellation:</p>

</p>

<p>I resolv'd therefore to place these, the principal Materials, under the
awful Guard of the immortal <i>Shakespear</i>, <i>Milton</i>, <i>Dryden</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>Procul o procul este Profani!</i></span><span class="figright">Virg.</span><br />
</p>

<p>But let Men of better Minds be excited to a generous Emulation.</p>

<p>I have inserted not only Similes, Allusions, Characters, and
Descriptions; but also the most Natural and Sublime Thoughts of our
Modern Poets on all Subjects whatever. I say, of our Modern; for tho'
some of the Antient, as <i>Chaucer</i>, <i>Spencer</i>, and others, have not been
excell'd, perhaps not equall'd, by any that have succeeded them, either
in Justness of Description, or in Propriety and Greatness of Thought;
yet their Language is now become so antiquated and obsolete, that most
Readers of our Age have no Ear for them: And this is the Reason that
the good <i>Shakespear</i> himself is not so frequently cited in this
Collection, as he would otherwise deserve to be.</p>

<p>I have endeavour'd to give the Passages as naked and stript of
Superfluities and foreign Matter, as possibly I could: but often found
my self oblig'd for the sake of the Connexion of the Sense, which else
would have been interrupted, and consequently obscure, to insert some of
them under Heads, to which every Part or Line of them may be thought not
properly to belong: Nay, I sometimes even found it difficult to chuse
under what Head to place several of the best Thoughts; but the Reader
may be assur'd, that if he find them not where he expects, he will not
wholly lose his Labour; for</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 6em;"><i>The Search it self rewards his Pains;</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>And if like Chymists his great End he miss,</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;"><i>Yet things well worth his Toil he gains;</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;"><i>And does his Charge and Labour pay</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>With good unsought Experiments by the way.</i></span><span class="figright">Cowley.</span><br />
</p>

<p>That the Reader may judge of every Passage with due Deference for each
Author, he will find their Names at the End of the last Line; and as the
late Versions of the Greek and Roman Poets have not a little
contributed to this Collection, <i>Homer</i>, <i>Anacreon</i>, <i>Lucretius</i>,
<i>Catullus</i>, <i>Virgil</i>, <i>Horace</i>, <i>Ovid</i>, <i>Juvenal</i>, &amp;c. are cited with
their Translators: And after each Author's Name are quoted their Plays
and other Poems, from whence the Passages are extracted.</p>

<p>The Reader will likewise observe, that I have sometimes ascrib'd to
several Authors the Quotations taken from one and the same Play. Thus to
those from the first and third Act of <i>Oedipus</i>, I have put <i>Dryden</i>; to
those from the three other, <i>Lee</i>: Because the first and third Act of
that Play were written by <i>Dryden</i>, the three other by <i>Lee</i>. To those
from <i>Troilus</i> and <i>Cressida</i> I have sometimes put <i>Shakespear</i>,
sometimes <i>Dryden</i>; because he having alter'd that Play, whatever I
found not in the Edition of <i>Shakespear</i>, ought to be ascrib'd to him.
And in like manner of several other Plays.</p>

<p>As no Thought can be justly said to be fine, unless it be true, I have
all along had a great regard for Truth; except only in Passages that
are purely Satirical, where some Allowance must be given: For Satire may
be fine and true Satire, tho' it be not directly and according to the
Letter, true: 'tis enough that it carry with it a Probability or
Semblance of Truth. Let it not here be objected, that I have from the
Translators of the Greek and Roman Poets, taken some Descriptions meerly
fabulous: for the well-invented Fables of the Antients were design'd
only to inculcate the Truth with more Delight, and to make it shine with
greater Splendour.</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>Rien n'est beau que le Vrai. Le Vrai seul est Aimable:</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>Il doit regner par tout; &amp; meme dans la Fable:</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>De toute Fiction l'adroite Fausseté</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>Ne tend qu' à faire aux yeux briller la Verité.</i></span><span class="figright">Boileau.</span><br />
</p>

<p>I have upon every Subject given both <i>Pro</i> and <i>Con</i> whenever I met with
them, or that I judg'd them worth giving: and if both are not always
found, let none imagine that I wilfully suppress'd either; or that what
is here uncontradicted must be unanswerable.</p>

<p>If any take Offence at the Loosness of some of the Thoughts, as
particularly upon <i>Love</i>, where I have given the different Sentiments
which Mankind, according to their several Temperaments, ever had, and
ever will have of it; such may observe, that I have strictly avoided all
manner of Obscenity throughout the whole Collection: And tho' here and
there a Thought may perhaps have a Cast of Wantonness, yet the cleanly
Metaphors palliate the Broadness of the Meaning, and the Chastness of
the Words qualifies the Lasciviousness of the Images they represent. And
let them farther know, that I have not always chosen what I most
approv'd, but what carries with it the best Stroaks for Imitation: For,
upon the whole matter, it was not my Business to judge any farther, than
of the Vigour and Force of Thought, of the Purity of Language, of the
Aptness and Propriety of Expression; and above all, of the Beauty of
Colouring, in which the Poet's Art chiefly consists. Nor, in short,
would I take upon me to determine what things should have been said; but
have shewn only what are said, and in what manner.</p>

<hr style="width: 100%;" />

<p>In the <i>English</i> Versification there are two Things chiefly to be
consider'd;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">1. The Verses.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">2. The several Sorts of Poems, or Compositions in Verse.</span><br />
</p>

<p>But because in the Verses there are also two Things to be observ'd; The
Structure of the Verse; and the Rhyme; this Treatise shall be divided
into three Chapters.</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">I. Of the Structure of <i>English</i> Verses.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">II. Of Rhyme.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">III. Of the several Sorts of Poems, or Compositions in Verse.</span><br />

<h2><a name="CHAP_I" id="CHAP_I"></a>CHAP. I.</h2>

<p class="center"><i>Of the Structure of</i> English <i>Verses.</i><br /><br /></p>

<p class="para2">The Structure of our Verses, whether Blank, or in Rhyme, consists in a
certain Number of Syllables; not in Feet compos'd of long and short
Syllables, as the Verses of the <i>Greeks</i> and <i>Romans</i>. And though some
ingenious Persons formerly puzzled themselves in prescribing Rules for
the Quantity of <i>English</i> Syllables, and, in Imitation of the <i>Latins</i>,
compos'd Verses by the measure of <i>Spondees</i>, <i>Dactyls</i>, &amp;c., yet the
Success of their Undertaking has fully evinc'd the Vainness of their
Attempt, and given ground to suspect they had not throughly weigh'd what
the Genius of our Language would bear; nor reflected that each Tongue
has its peculiar Beauties, and that what is agreeable and natural to
one, is very often disagreeable, nay, inconsistent with another. But
that Design being now wholly exploded, it is sufficient to have
mention'd it.</p>

<p>Our Verses then consist in a certain Number of Syllables; but the Verses
of double Rhyme require a Syllable more than those of single <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>Rhyme. Thus
in a Poem whose Verses consist of ten Syllables, those of the same Poem
that are accented on the last save one, which we call Verses of double
Rhyme, must have eleven; as may be seen by these Verses.</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 3em;"><i>A Man so various that he seem'd to be</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>Not one, but all Mankind's Epitome:</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>Stiff in Opinion, always in the Wrong,</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>Was ev'ry thing by starts, and nothing long:</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>But, in the Course of one revolving Moon,</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>Was Fidler, Chymist, Statesman, and Buffoon:</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>Then all for Women, Painting, Rhyming, Drinking;</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>Besides ten thousand Freaks that dy'd in Thinking.</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>Praising and Railing were his usual Themes;</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>And both, to shew his Judgment, in Extreams.</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>So over-violent, or over-civil</i>,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>That every Man with him was God or Devil.</i></span><span class="figright">Dryd.</span><br />
</p>

<p class="para2">Where the 4 Verses that are accented on the last save one, have 11
Syllables; the others, accented on the last, but 10.</p>

<p>In a Poem whose Verses consist of 8, the double Rhymes require 9, as,</p>

<p class="para2">
<span style="margin-left: 3em;"><i>When hard Words, Jealousies and Fears,</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>Set Folks together by the Ears;</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>And made 'em fight, like mad, or drunk,</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>For Dame Religion, as for Punk;</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>Whose Honesty they all durst swear for,</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>Tho' not a Man of 'em know wherefore:</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>Then did Sir Knight abandon Dwelling,</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>And out he rode a Collonelling.</i></span><span class="figright">Hud.</span><br />
</p>

<p>In a Poem whose Verses consist of 7, the double Rhymes require 8, as,</p>

<p class="para2">
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>All thy Verse is softer far</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>Than the downy Feathers are</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>Of my Wings, or of my Arrows;</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>Of my Mother's Doves or Sparrows.</i></span><span class="figright">Cowl.</span><br />
</p>

<p>This must also be observ'd in Blank Verse; as,</p>

<p class="para2">
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>Welcom, thou worthy Partner of my Lawrels!</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>Thou Brother of my Choice! a Band more sacred</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>Than Nature's brittle Tye. By holy Friendship!</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>Glory and Fame stood still for thy Arrival,</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>My Soul seem'd wanting of its better Half,</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>And languish'd for thy Absence, like a Prophet,</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>Who waits the Inspiration of his God.</i></span><span class="figright">Rowe.</span><br />
</p>

<p>And this Verse of <i>Milton</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span></p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>Void of all Succour and needful Comfort,</i></span><br />
</p>

<p>wants a Syllable; for, being accented on the last save one, it ought to
have 11, as all the Verses, but two, of the preceeding Example have: But
if we transpose the Words thus,</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>Of Succour and all needful Comfort void,</i></span><br />
</p>

<p>it then wants nothing of its due Measure, because it is accented on the
last Syllable.<br /></p>

<hr style="width: 100%;" />
<h3>SECT. I.</h3>

<p class="center2"><i>Of the several Sorts of Verses; and first of those of ten
Syllables. Of the due Observation of the Accent; and of the
Pause.</i></p>

<p class="para2">Our Poetry admits for the most part but of three sorts of Verses; that
is to say, of Verses of 10, 8, or 7 Syllables: Those of 4, 6, 9, 11, 12,
and 14, are generally imploy'd in Masks and Operas, and in the Stanzas
of Lyrick and Pindarick Odes, and we have few intire Poems compos'd in
any of those sorts of Verses. Those of 12, and of 14 Syllables, are
frequently inserted in our Poems in Heroick Verse, and when rightly made
use of, carry a peculiar Grace with them. <i>See the next Section towards
the end.</i></p>

<p>The Verses of 10 Syllables, which are our Heroick, are us'd in Heroick
Poems, in Tragedies, Comedies, Pastorals, Elegies; and sometimes in
Burlesque.</p>

<p>In these Verses two things are chiefly to be consider'd.</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">1. The Seat of the Accent.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">2. The Pause.</span><br />
</p>

<p>For, 'tis not enough that Verses have their just Number of Syllables:
the true Harmony of them depends on a due Observation of the Accent and
Pause.</p>

<p>The Accent is an Elevation, or a Falling of the Voice, on a certain
Syllable of a Word.</p>

<p>The Pause is a Rest or Stop that is made in pronouncing the Verse, and
that divides it, as it were, into two parts; each of which is call'd an
Hemistich, or Half-Verse.</p>

<p class="para2">But this Division is not always equal, that is to say, one of the
Half-verses does not always contain the same Number of Syllables as the
other: and this Inequality proceeds from the Seat of the Accent that is
strongest, and prevails most in the first Half-verse. For, the Pause
must be observ'd at the end of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span> the Word where such Accent happens to
be, or at the end of the following Word.</p>

<p class="para2">Now in a Verse of 10 Syllables, this Accent must be either on the 2d,
4th, or 6th; which produces 5 several Pauses, that is to say, at the 3d,
4th, 5th, 6th, or 7th Syllable of the Verse; For,</p>

<p>When it happens to be on the 2d, the Pause will be either at the 3d, or
4th.</p>

<p>At the 3d, in two manners:</p>

<p>1. When the Syllable accented happens to be the last save one of a Word;
as,</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>As busy&mdash;as intentive Emmets are;</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>Or Cities&mdash;whom unlook'd-for Sieges scare.</i></span><span class="figright">Dav.</span><br />
</p>

<p>2. Or, when the Accent is on the last of a Word, and the next a
Monosyllable, whose Construction is govern'd by that on which the Accent
is; as,</p>

<p class="para2">
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>Despise it,&mdash;and more noble Thoughts pursue.</i></span><span class="figright">Dryd.</span><br />
</p>

<p>When the Accent falls on the 2d Syllable of the Verse, and the last save
two of a Word, the Pause will be at the 4th; as,</p>

<p class="para2">
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>He meditates&mdash;his absent Enemy.</i></span><span class="figright">Dryd.</span><br />
</p>

<p>When the Accent is on the 4th of a Verse, the Pause will be either at
the same Syllable, or at the 5th, or 6th.</p>

<p>At the same, when the Syllable of the Accent happens to be the last of a
Word; as,</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>Such huge Extreams&mdash;inhabit thy great Mind,</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>God-like, unmov'd,&mdash;and yet, like Woman, kind.</i></span><span class="figright">Wall.</span><br />
</p>

<p>At the 5th in 2 manners:</p>

<p>1. When it happens to be the last save one of a Word; as,</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>Like bright</i> Aurora&mdash;<i>whose refulgent Ray</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>Foretells the Fervour&mdash;of ensuing Day;</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>And warns the Shepherd&mdash;with his Flocks, retreat</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>To leafy Shadows&mdash;from the threaten'd Heat.</i></span><span class="figright">Wall.</span><br />
</p>

<p>2. Or the last of the Word, if the next be a Monosyllable govern'd by
it; as,</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>So fresh the Wound is&mdash;and the Grief so vast.</i></span><span class="figright">Wall.</span><br />
</p>

<p>At the 6th, when the Syllable of the Accent happens to be the last save
two of a Word; as,</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>Those Seeds of Luxury,&mdash;Debate, and Pride.</i></span><span class="figright">Wall.</span><br />
</p>

<p>Lastly, When the Accent is on the 6th Syllable of the Verse, the Pause
will be either at the same Syllable, or at the 7th.</p>

<p>At the same, when the Syllable of the Accent happens to be the last of a
Word; as,</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>She meditates Revenge&mdash;resolv'd to die.</i></span><span class="figright">Wall.</span><br />
</p>

<p>At the 7th in two manners:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span></p>

<p>1. When it happens to be the last save one of a Word; as,</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>Nor when the War is over,&mdash;is it Peace.</i></span><span class="figright">Dryd.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>Mirrors are taught to flatter,&mdash;but our Springs.</i></span><span class="figright"> Wall.</span><br />
</p>

<p>2. Or the last of a Word, if the following one be a Monosyllable whose
Construction depends on the preceeding Word on which the Accent is; as,</p>

<p class="para2">
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>And since he could not save her,&mdash;with her dy'd.</i></span><span class="figright">Dryd.</span><br />
</p>

<p>From all this it appears, that the Pause is determin'd by the Seat of
the Accent; but if the Accents happen to be equally strong, on the 2d,
4th, and 6th Syllable of a Verse, the Sense and Construction of the
Words must then guide to the Observation of the Pause: For Example; In
one of the Verses I cited as an Instance of it at the 7th Syllable,</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>Mirrors are taught to flatter, but our Springs.</i></span><br />
</p>

<p class="para2">The Accent is as strong on <i>Taught</i>, as on the first Syllable of
<i>Flatter</i>, and if the Pause were observ'd at the 4th Syllable of the
Verse, it would have nothing disagreeable in its Sound: as,</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>Mirrors are taught&mdash;to flatter, but our Springs</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>Present th' impartial Images of things.</i></span><br />
</p>

<p class="para2">Which tho' it be no Violence to the Ear, yet it is to the Sense, and
that ought always carefully to be avoided in reading or in repeating of
Verses.</p>

<p>For this Reason it is, that the Construction or Sense should never end
at a Syllable where the Pause ought not to be made; as at the 8th and 2d
in the two following Verses:</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>Bright</i> Hesper <i>twinkles from afar:&mdash;Away</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>My Kids!&mdash;for you have had a Feast to day.</i></span><span class="figright">Staff.</span><br />
</p>

<p class="para2">Which Verses have nothing disagreeable in their Structure but the Pause;
which in the first of them must be observ'd at the 8th Syllable, in the
2d at the 2d; and so unequal a Division can produce no true Harmony. And
for this Reason too, the Pauses at the 3d and 7th Syllables, tho' not
wholly to be condemn'd, ought to be but sparingly practis'd.</p>

<p>The foregoing Rules ought indispensibly to be follow'd in all our Verses
of 10 Syllables; and the observation of them, like that of right Time in
Musick, will produce Harmony; the neglect of them, Harshness and
Discord; as appears by the following Verses.</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>None think Rewards render'd worthy their Worth.</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>And both Lovers, both thy Disciples were,</i></span><span class="figright">Dav.</span><br />
</p>

<p>In which tho' the true Number of Syllables be observ'd, yet neither of
them have so much as the Sound of a Verse: Now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span> their Disagreeableness
proceeds from the undue Seat of the Accent: For Example, the first of
them is accented on the 5th and 7th Syllables; but if we change the
Words, and remove the Accent to the 4th and 6th, the Verse will become
smooth and easie; as,</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>None think Rewards are equal to their Worth.</i></span><br />
</p>

<p>The harshness of the last of them proceeds from its being accented on
the 3d Syllable, which may be mended thus, by transposing only one Word;</p>

<p class="para2">
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>And Lovers both, both thy Disciples were.</i></span><br />
</p>

<p>In like manner the following Verses,</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>To be massacred, not in Battle slain.</i></span><span class="figright">Blac.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>But forc'd, harsh, and uneasie unto all.</i></span><span class="figright">Cowl.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>Against the Insults of the Wind and Tide.</i></span><span class="figright">Blac.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>A second Essay will the Pow'rs appease.</i></span><span class="figright">Blac.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>With</i> Scythians <i>expert in the Dart and Bow.</i></span><span class="figright">Dryd.</span><br />
</p>

<p>are rough, because the foregoing Rules are not observ'd in their
Structure: For Example, the first, where the Pause is at the 5th
Syllable, and the Accent on the 3d, is contrary to the Rule which says,
that the Accent that determines the Pause must be on the 2d, 4th, or 6th
Syllable of the Verse; and to mend that Verse we need only place the
Accent on the 4th, and then the Pause at the 5th will have nothing
disagreeable, as,</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>Thus to be murther'd, not in Battle slain.</i></span><br />
</p>

<p>The second Verse is Accented on the 3d Syllable, and the Pause is there
too; which makes it indeed the thing it expresses, forc'd, harsh, and
uneasie; it may be mended thus,</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>But forc'd and harsh, uneasie unto all.</i></span><br />
</p>

<p>The 3d, 4th, and 5th of those Verses, have like faults; for the Pauses
are at the 5th, and the Accent there too, which is likewise contrary to
the foregoing Rules: Now they will be made smooth and flowing, by taking
the Accent from the 5th, and removing the Seat of the Pause; as,</p>

<p class="para2">
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>Against th' Insults both of the Wind and Tide.</i></span><br />

<p>From whence we conclude, that in all Verses of 10 Syllables, the most
prevailing Accents ought to be on the 2d, 4th, or 6th Syllables; for if
they are on the 3d, 5th, or 7th, the Verses will be rough and
disagreeable, as has been prov'd by the preceeding Instances.</p>

<p>In short, the wrong placing of the Accent is as great a fault in our
Versification, as false Quantity was in that of the Antients; and
therefore we ought to take equal care to avoid it, and endeavour so to
dispose the Words, that they may create a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span> certain Melody in the Ear,
without Labour to the Tongue, or Violence to the Sense.</p>

<p class="para2">After the Verses of 10 Syllables, those of 8 are most frequent, and we
have many intire Poems compos'd in them.</p>

<p>In the Structure of these Verses, as well as of those of 10 Syllables,
we must take care that the most prevailing Accents be neither on the 3d
nor 5th Syllables of them.</p>

<p>They also require a Pause to be observ'd in pronouncing them, which is
generally at the 4th, or 5th Syllable; as,</p>

<p>The Verses of 7 Syllables, which are call'd <i>Anacreontick</i>, are most
beautiful when the strongest Accent is on the 3d, and the Pause either
there, or at the 4th, as,</p>

<p>The Verses of 9, and of 11 Syllables, are of two sorts, one is those
that are accented upon the last save one, which are only the Verses of
double Rhyme that belong to those of 8 and 10 Syllables, of which
Examples have already been given. The other is those that are accented
on the last Syllable, which are employ'd only in Compositions for
Musick, and in the lowest sort of Burlesque Poetry; the disagreeableness
of their Measure having wholly excluded them from grave and serious
Subjects. They who desire to see Examples of them, may find some
scatter'd here and there in our Masks, and Operas, and in our Burlesque
Writers. I will give but two.</p>

</p>

<p class="para2">The Verses of 12 Syllables are truly Heroick, both in their Measure and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
Sound; tho' we have no intire Works compos'd in them; and they are so
far from being a Blemish to the Poems they are in, that on the contrary,
when rightly employed, they conduce not a little to the Ornament of
them; particularly in the following Rencounters.</p>

<p>1. When they conclude an Episode in an Heroick Poem: Thus <i>Stafford</i>
ends his Translation of that of <i>Camilla</i> from the 11th Æneid, with a
Verse of 12 Syllables.</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>The ling'ring Soul th' unwelcom Doom receives,</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>And, murm'ring with Disdain, the beauteous Body leaves.</i></span><br />
</p>

<p>2. When they conclude a Triplet and full Sense together; as,</p>

<div class="floatright" style="width: 20px;">
<img src="images/newbrace3.png" width="20" height="52" alt="" title="" />
</div>
<p class="para2">
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>Millions of op'ning Mouths to Fame belong;</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>And every Mouth is furnish'd with a Tongue;</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>And round with list'ning Ears the flying Plague is hung.</i></span><span class="right">Dryd.</span><br />
</p>

<p>And here we may observe by the way, that whenever a Triplet is made use
of in an Heroick Poem, it is a fault not to close the Sense at the end
of the Triplet, but to continue it into the next Line; as <i>Dryden</i> has
done in his Translation of the 11th Æneid in those Lines.</p>

<div class="floatright" style="width: 20px;">
<img src="images/newbrace3.png" width="20" height="52" alt="" title="" />

<p>

<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>And Sums of Gold</i>, &amp;c.</span><br />
</p>

<p>And in the 7th Æneid he has committed the like fault.</p>

<div class="floatright" style="width: 20px;">
<img src="images/newbrace3.png" width="20" height="52" alt="" title="" />
</div>
<p class="para2">
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>Then they, whose Mothers, frantick with their Fear,</i></span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>And lead his Dances with dishevel'd Hair,</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>Increase the Clamour</i>, &amp;c.</span><br /></p>

<p class="para2">But the Sense is not confin'd to the Couplet, for the Close of it may
fall into the middle of the next Verse, that is the Third, and sometimes
farther off: Provided the last Verse of the Couplet exceed not the
Number of ten Syllables; for then the Sense ought always to conclude
with it. Examples of this are so frequent, that 'tis needless to give
any.</p>

<p>3. When they conclude the Stanzas of Lyrick or Pindarick Odes; Examples
of which are often seen in <i>Dryden</i>, and others.</p>

<p>In these Verses the Pause ought to be at the 6th Syllable, as may be
seen in the foregoing Examples.</p>

<p>We sometimes find it, tho' very rarely, at the 7th; as,</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>That such a cursed Creature&mdash;lives so long a space.</i></span><br />
</p>

<p>When it is at the 4th, the Verse will be rough and hobbling: as,</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>And Midwife Time&mdash;the ripen'd Plot to Murther brought.</i></span><span class="figright">Dryd.</span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>The Prince pursu'd&mdash;and march'd along with equal Pace.</i></span><span class="figright">Dryd.</span><br />
</p>

<p>In the last of which it is very apparent, that if the Sense and
Construction would allow us to make the Pause at the 6th Syllable,</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>The Prince pursu'd, and march'd&mdash;along with equal Pace.</i></span><br />
</p>

<p>the Verse would be much more flowing and easie.</p>

<p>The Verses of 14 Syllables are less frequent than those of 12; they are
likewise inserted in Heroick Poems, <i>&amp;c.</i> and are agreeable enough when
they conclude a Triplet and Sense, and follow a Verse of 12; as,</p>

<div class="floatright" style="width: 20px;">
<img src="images/newbrace3.png" width="20" height="52" alt="" title="" />
</div>
<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>For thee the Land in fragrant Flowers is drest</i>;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>For thee the Ocean smiles, and smooths her wavy Breast</i>,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>And Heav'n it self with more serene and purer Light is blest.</i></span><span class="right">Dryd.</span><br />
</p>

<p>But if they follow one of 10 Syllables, the Inequality of the Measure
renders them less agreeable; as,</p>


<div class="floatright" style="width: 20px;">
<img src="images/newbrace3.png" width="20" height="52" alt="" title="" />
</div><p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>While all thy Province, Nature, I survey</i>,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>And sing to</i> Memmius <i>an Immortal Lay</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>Of Heav'n and Earth; and every where thy wondrous Pow'r display</i></span><span class="right">(Dryd.</span><br />
</p>

<p>Especially if it be the last of a Couplet only; as,</p>

<p class="para2">
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>With Court-Informers haunts, and Royal Spies,</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>Things done relates, not done she feigns, and mingles Truth with Lies.</i></span><span class="figright">(Dryd.</span><br />
</p>

<p>But this is only in Heroicks; for in Pindaricks and Lyricks, Verses of
12 or 14 Syllables are frequently and gracefully plac'd, not only after
those of 12 or 10, but of any other number of Syllables whatsoever.</p>

<p>The Verses of 4 and 6 Syllables have nothing worth observing, and
therefore I shall content my self with having made mention of them. They
are, as I said before, us'd only in Operas, and Masks, and in Lyrick and
Pindarick Odes. Take one Example of them.</p>

<h3>SECT. III.</h3>

<p class="center2"><i>Several Rules conducing to the Beauty of our Versification.</i></p>

<p class="para2">Our Poetry being very much polish'd and refin'd since the Days of
<i>Chaucer</i>, <i>Spencer</i> and the other antient Poets,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span> some Rules which they
neglected, and that conduce very much to the Ornament of it, have been
practis'd by the best of the Moderns.</p>

<p>The first is, to avoid as much as possible the Concourse of Vowels,
which occasions a certain ill-sounding Gaping, call'd by the Latins
<i>Hiatus</i>; and which they thought so disagreeable to the Ear, that, to
avoid it, whenever a Word ended in a Vowel, and the next began with one,
they never, even in Prose, sounded the Vowel of the first Word, but lost
it in the Pronunciation; and it is a fault in our Poets not to do the
like, whenever our Language will admit of it.</p>

<p>For this Reason, the <i>e</i> of the Particle <i>The</i> ought always to be cut
off before the Words that begin by a Vowel; as,</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>With weeping Eyes she heard th' unwelcome News.</i></span><span class="figright">Dryd.</span><br />
</p>

<p>And it is a fault to make <i>The</i> and the first Syllable of the following
word two distinct Syllables, as in this,</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>Refrain'd a while by the unwelcome Night.</i></span><span class="figright">Wall.</span><br />
</p>

<p>A second sort of <i>Hiatus</i>, and that ought no less to be avoided is, when
a Word that ends in a Vowel that cannot be cut off, is plac'd before one
that begins by the same Vowel, or one that has the like Sound; as,</p>

<p class="para2">
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>Should thy Iambicks swell into a Book.</i></span><span class="figright">Wall.</span><br />
</p>

<p>The second Rule is, to contract the two last Syllables of the
Preterperfect Tenses of all the Verbs that will admit of it; which are
all the Regular Verbs whatsoever, except only those ending in D or T,
and DE or TE. And it is a fault to make <i>Amazed</i> of three Syllables, and
<i>Loved</i> of two; instead of <i>Amaz'd</i> of two, and <i>Lov'd</i> of one.</p>

<p class="para2">And the second Person of the Present and Preterperfect Tenses of all
Verbs ought to be contracted in like manner; as <i>thou lov'st</i>, for <i>thou
lovest</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The third Rule is, not to make use of several Words in a Verse that
begin by the same Letter; as,</p>

<p class="para2">
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>The Court he knew to steer in Storms of State.</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>He in these Miracles Design discern'd.</i></span><span class="figright"> Dav.</span><br />
</p>

<p>Yet we find an Instance of such a Verse in <i>Dryden's</i> Translation of the
first Pastoral of <i>Virgil</i>;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>Till then a helpless, hopeless, homely Swain.</i></span><br />
</p>

<p>Which I am perswaded he left not thus through Negligence or
Inadvertency, but with design to paint in the Number and Sound of the
Words the thing he describ'd, a Shepherd in whom</p>

<p class="para2">
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>Nec spes libertatis erat, nec cura peculi.</i></span><br />
</p>

<p class="para2">Now how far the Sound of the <i>H</i> aspirate, with which three Feet of that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
Verse begin, expresses the Despair of the Swain, let the Judicious
judge: I have taken notice of it only to say, that 'tis a great Beauty
in Poetry, when the Words and Numbers are so dispos'd, as by their Order
and Sound to represent the things describ'd.</p>

<p>The fourth is, to avoid ending a Verse by an Adjective whose Substantive
begins the following; as,</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>Some lost their quiet Rivals, some their kind</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>Parents</i>, &amp;c.</span><span class="figright">Dav.</span><br />
</p>

<p>Or, by a Preposition when the Case it governs begins the Verse that
follows; as,</p>

<p class="para2">
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>The daily less'ning of our Life, shews by</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>A little dying, how outright to dye.</i></span><span class="figright">Wall.</span><br />
</p>

<p>The fifth is, to avoid the frequent Use of Words of many Syllables,
which are proper enough in Prose, but come not into Verse without a
certain Violence altogether disagreeable; particularly those whose
Accent is on the fourth Syllable from the last; as <i>Undutifulness</i>.</p>


<hr style="width: 100%;" />
<h3>SECT. IV.</h3>

<p class="center2"><i>Doubts concerning the Number of Syllables of certain Words.</i></p>

<p class="para2">There is no Language whatsoever, that so often joyns several Vowels
together to make Diphthongs of them, as ours; this appears in our having
several compos'd of three different Vowels: as EAU, and EOU in
<i>Beauteous</i>: IOU in <i>Glorious</i>, UAI in <i>Acquaint</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p class="para2">Now from hence may arise some Difficulties concerning the true
Pronunciation of those Vowels: Whether they ought to be sounded
separately in two Syllables, or joyntly in one.</p>

<p class="para2">The antient Poets made them sometimes of two Syllables, sometimes but of
one, as the Measure of their Verse requir'd; but they are now become to
be but of one, and it is a fault to make them of two: From whence we may
draw this general Rule;</p>

<p>That whenever one Syllable of a Word ends in a Vowel, and the next<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
begins by one, provided the first of those Syllables be not that on
which the Word is accented, those two Syllables ought in Verse to be
contracted and made but one.</p>

<p>Thus <i>Beauteous</i> is but two Syllables, <i>Victorious</i> but three, and it is
a fault in <i>Dryden</i>, to make it four, as he has done in this Verse:</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>Your Arms are on the</i> Rhine <i>victorious.</i></span><br />
</p>

<p>To prove that this Verse wants a Syllable of its due Measure, we need
but add one to it; as,</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>Your Arms are on the</i> Rhine <i>victorious now.</i></span><br />
</p>

<p>Where tho' the Syllable <i>now</i> be added to the Verse, it has no more than
its due number of Syllables, which plainly proves it wanted it.</p>

<p>But if the Accent be upon the first of these Syllables, they cannot be
contracted to make a Diphthong, but must be computed as two distinct
Syllables: Thus <i>Poet</i>, <i>Lion</i>, <i>Quiet</i>, and the like, must always be
us'd as two Syllables: <i>Poetry</i> and the like, as three.</p>

<p>And it is a fault to make <i>Riot</i>, for Example, one Syllable, as <i>Milton</i>
has done in this Verse.</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>Their Riot ascends above their lofty Tow'rs.</i></span><br />
</p>

<p>The same Poet has in another place made use of a like Word twice in one
Verse, and made it two Syllables each time.</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>With Ruin upon Ruin, Rout on Rout.</i></span><br />
</p>

<p class="para2">And any Ear may discover that this last Verse has its true Measure, the
other not.</p>

<p>But there are some Words that may be excepted; as <i>Diamond</i>, <i>Violet</i>,
<i>Violent</i>, <i>Diadem</i>, <i>Hyacinth</i>, and perhaps some others, which, though
they are accented upon the first Vowel, are sometimes us'd but as two
Syllables; as in the following Verses,</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>From Diamond Quarries hewn, and Rocks of Gold.</i></span><span class="figright">Milt.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>With Poppies, Daffadils, and Violets joyn'd.</i></span><span class="figright">Tate.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>With vain, but violent Force their Darts they flung.</i></span><span class="figright">Cowl.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>His Ephod, Mitre, well-cut Diadem on.</i></span><span class="figright">Cowl.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>My blushing Hyacinths, and my Bays I keep.</i></span><span class="figright">Dryd.</span><br />
</p>

<p>Sometimes as three; as</p>

<p class="para2">
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>A Mount of rocky Diamond did rise.</i></span><span class="figright">Blac.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>Hence the blue Violet and blushing Rose.</i></span><span class="figright">Blac.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>And set soft Hyacinths of Iron Blue.</i></span><span class="figright">Dryd.</span><br />
</p>

<p class="para2">When they are us'd but as two Syllables they suffer an Elision of one of
their Vowels, and are generally written thus, <i>Di'mond</i>, <i>Vi'let</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p>This Contraction is not always made of Syllables of the same Word only;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
for the Particle <i>A</i> being plac'd after a Word that ends in a Vowel,
will sometimes admit of the like Contraction: For Example, after the
Word <i>many</i>; as,</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>Tho' many a Victim from my Folds was bought,</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>And many a Cheese to Country-Markets brought.</i></span><span class="figright">Dryd.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>They many a Trophy gain'd with many a Wound.</i></span><span class="figright">Dav.</span><br />
</p>

<p>After <i>To</i>; as,</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>Can he to a Friend, to a Son so bloody grow.</i></span><span class="figright">Cowl.</span><br />
</p>

<p>After <i>They</i>; as,</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>From thee, their long-known King, they a King desire.</i></span><span class="figright">Cowl.</span><br />
</p>

<p>After <i>By</i>; as,</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>When we by a foolish Figure say.</i></span><span class="figright">Cowl.</span><br />
</p>

<p class="para2">And perhaps after some others.</p>

<p class="para2">There are also other Words whose Syllables are sometimes contracted,
sometimes not: as, <i>Bower</i>, <i>Heaven</i>, <i>Prayer</i>, <i>Nigher</i>, <i>Towards</i>, and
many more of the like Nature: But they generally ought to be us'd but as
one Syllable; and then they suffer an Elision of the Vowel that precedes
their final Consonant, and ought to be written thus: <i>Pow'r</i>, <i>Heav'n</i>,
<i>Pray'r</i>, <i>Nigh'r</i>, <i>tow'rds</i>.</p>

<p>The Termination ISM is always us'd but as one Syllable; as</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>Where griesly Schism and raging Strife appear.</i></span><span class="figright">Cowl.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>And Rhumatisms I send to rack the Joynts.</i></span><span class="figright">Dryd.</span><br />
</p>

<p>And, indeed, considering that it has but one Vowel, it may seem absurd
to assert that it ought to be reckon'd two Syllables; yet in my Opinion,
those Verses seem to have a Syllable more than their due Measure, and
would run better if we took one from them; as,</p>

<p class="para2">
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>Where griesly Schism, raging Strife appear.</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>I Rhumatisms send to rack the Joynts.</i></span><br />
</p>

<p class="para2">Yet this Opinion being contrary to the constant practice of our Poets, I
shall not presume to advance it as a Rule for others to follow; but
leave it to be decided by such as are better Judges of Poetical Numbers.</p>

<p>The like may be said of the Terminations ASM and OSM.</p>

<h3>SECT. V.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span></h3>

<p class="center2"><i>Of the Elisions that are allow'd in our Versification.</i></p>

<p class="para2">Our Verses consisting only of a certain Number of Syllables, nothing can
be of more ease, or greater use to our Poets, than the retaining or
cutting off a Syllable from a Verse, according as the measure of it
requires; and therefore it is requisite to treat of the Elisions that
are allowable in our Poetry, some of which have been already taken
notice of in the preceding Section.</p>

<p class="para2">By Elision, I mean the cutting off one or more Letters from a Word,
whereby two Syllables come to be contracted into one; or the taking away
an intire Syllable. Now when in a Word of more than two Syllables, which
is accented on the last save two, the Liquid R, happens to be between
two Vowels, that which precedes the Liquid admits of an Elision, Of this
nature are many Words in ANCE, ENCE, ENT, ER, OUS, and RY; as
<i>Temperance</i>, <i>Preference</i>, <i>Different</i>, <i>Flatterer</i>, <i>Amorous</i>,
<i>Victory</i>: Which are Words of three Syllables, and often us'd as such in
Verse; but they may also be contracted into two, by cutting off the
Vowel that precedes the Liquid; as <i>Temp'rance</i>, <i>Pref'rence</i>,
<i>Diff'rent</i>, <i>Flatt'rer</i>, <i>Am'rous</i>, <i>Vict'ry</i>. The like Elision is
sometimes us'd, when any of the other Liquids L, M, or N, happen to be
between two Vowels, in Words accented like the former, as <i>Fabulous</i>,
<i>Enemy</i>, <i>Mariner</i>, which may be contracted <i>Fab'lous</i>, <i>En'my</i>,
<i>Mar'ner</i>. But this is not so frequent.</p>

<p>Observe, that I said accented on the last save two; for if the Word be
accented on the last save one, that is to say, on the Vowel that
precedes the Liquid, that Vowel may not be cut off. And therefore it is
a fault to make, for Example, <i>Sonorous</i> of two Syllables, as in this
Verse;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>With Son'rous Metals wak'd the drowsie Day.</i></span><span class="figright">Blac.</span><br />
</p>

<p>Which always ought to be of three; as in this,</p>

<p class="para2">
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>Sonorous Metals blowing martial Sounds.</i></span><span class="figright">Milt.</span><br />
</p>

<p class="para2">In like manner; whenever the Letter S happens to be between two Vowels
in Words of three Syllables, accented on the first, one of the Vowels
may be cut off; as <i>Pris'ner</i>, <i>Bus'ness</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Or the Letter C when 'tis sounded like S; that is to say,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span> whenever it
preceds the Vowels E or I; as <i>Med'cine</i>, for <i>Medicine</i>.</p>

<p class="para2">Or V Consonant; as <i>Cov'nant</i> for <i>Covenant</i>.</p>

<p class="para2">To these may be added the Gerunds of all Verbs whose Infinitives end in
any of the Liquids, preceded by a Vowel or Diphthong, and that are
accented on the last save one: for the Gerunds being form'd by adding
the Syllable ING to the Infinitive, the Liquid that was their final
Letter, comes thereby to be between two Vowels; and the Accent that was
on the last save one of the Infinitive, comes to be on the last save two
of the Gerund: And therefore the Vowel or Diphthong, that precedes the
Liquid, may be cut off; by means whereof the Gerund of three Syllables
comes to be but of two, as from <i>Travel</i>, <i>Travelling</i>, or <i>Trav'ling</i>;
from <i>Endeavour</i>, <i>Endeavouring</i>, or <i>Endeav'ring</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p>But if the Accent be on the last Syllable of such a Verb, its Gerund
will not suffer such an Elision: Thus the Gerund of <i>Devour</i> must always
be three Syllables, <i>Devouring</i>, not <i>Dev'ring</i>; because all Derivatives
still retain the Accent of their Primitives, that is, on the same
Syllable: and the Accent always obliges the Syllable on which it is, to
remain entire.</p>

<p class="para2">The Gerunds of the Verbs in OW, accented on the last save two, suffer an
Elision of the O that precedes the W; as <i>Foll'wing</i>, <i>Wall'wing</i>.</p>

<p class="para2">The Particle <i>It</i> admits of an Elision of its Vowel before <i>Is</i>, <i>Was</i>,
<i>Were</i>, <i>Will</i>, <i>Would</i>; as <i>'Tis</i>, <i>'Twas</i>, <i>'Twere</i>, <i>'Twill</i>,
<i>'Twould</i>, for <i>It is</i>, <i>It was</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p class="para2"><i>It</i> likewise sometimes suffers the like Elision, when plac'd after a
Word that ends in a Vowel; as <i>By't</i> for <i>By it</i>, <i>Do't</i> for <i>Do it</i>: Or
that ends in a Consonant after which the Letter T can be pronounc'd; as
<i>Was't</i> for <i>Was it</i>, <i>In't</i> for <i>In it</i>, and the like: But this is not
so frequent in Heroick Verse.</p>

<p>The Particle <i>Is</i> may lose its <i>I</i> after any Word that ends in a Vowel,
or in any of the Consonants after which the Letter S may be sounded; as
<i>she's</i> for <i>she is</i>: The <i>Air's</i> for the <i>Air is</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p class="para2"><i>To</i> (sign of the Infinitive Mood) may lose its O before any Verb that
begins by a Vowel; as <i>T' amaze</i>, <i>t' undo</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p class="para2"><i>To</i> (Sign of the Dative Case) may likewise lose its O before any Noun
that begins with a Vowel; as <i>t' Air</i>, <i>t' every</i>, <i>&amp;c.</i> But this
Elision is not so allowable as the former.</p>

<p class="para2"><i>Are</i> may lose its <i>A</i> after the Pronouns Personal, <i>We</i>, <i>You</i>, <i>They</i>;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
as <i>We're</i>, <i>You're</i>, <i>They're</i>: And thus it is that this Elision ought
to be made, and not as some do, by cutting off the final Vowels of the
Pronouns Personal; <i>W'are</i>, <i>Y'are</i>, <i>Th'are</i>.</p>

<p class="para2"><i>Will</i> and <i>Would</i> may lose all their first Letters, and retain only
their final one, after any of the Pronouns Personal; as <i>I'll</i> for <i>I
will</i>; <i>He'd</i> for <i>He would</i>; or after <i>Who</i>, as <i>who'll</i> for <i>who
will</i>; <i>who'd</i> for <i>who would</i>.</p>

<p class="para2"><i>Have</i>, may lose its two first Letters after <i>I</i>, <i>You</i>, <i>We</i>, <i>They</i>;
as <i>I've</i>, <i>You've</i>, <i>We've</i>, <i>They've</i>.</p>

<p class="para2"><i>Not</i>, its two first Letters after can; as <i>Can't</i> for <i>Can not</i>.</p>

<p class="para2"><i>Am</i>, its <i>A</i> after <i>I</i>: <i>I'm</i> for <i>I am</i>.</p>

<p class="para2"><i>Us</i>, its <i>U</i> after <i>Let</i>: <i>Let's</i> for <i>Let us</i>.</p>

<p class="para2"><i>Taken</i>, its <i>K</i>, as <i>Ta'en</i>: for so it ought to be written, not
<i>ta'ne</i>.</p>

<p class="para2"><i>Heaven</i>, <i>Seven</i>; <i>Even</i>, <i>Eleven</i>, and the Participles <i>Driven</i>,
<i>Given</i>, <i>Thriven</i>, and their Compounds, may lose their last Vowel, as
<i>Heav'n</i>, <i>Forgiv'n</i>, &amp;c. <i>See the foregoing Section, p. 13.</i></p>

<p class="para2">To these may be added <i>Bow'r</i>, <i>Pow'r</i>, <i>Flow'r</i>, <i>Tow'r</i>, <i>Show'r</i>, for
<i>Bower</i>, <i>Power</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p class="para2"><i>Never</i>, <i>Ever</i>, <i>Over</i>, may lose their <i>V</i>; and are contracted thus,
<i>Ne'er</i>, <i>E'er</i>, <i>O'er</i>.</p>

<p class="para2">Some Words admit of an Elision of their first Syllable; as <i>'Tween</i>,
<i>'Twixt</i>, <i>'Mong</i>, <i>'Mongst</i>, <i>'Gainst</i>, <i>'Bove</i>, <i>'Cause</i>, <i>'Fore</i>, for
<i>Between</i>, <i>Betwixt</i>, <i>Among</i>, <i>Amongst</i>, <i>Against</i>, <i>Above</i>, <i>Because</i>,
<i>Before</i>. And some others that may be observ'd in reading our Poets.</p>

<p class="para2">I have already, in the 3d Section of this Chapter, spoken of the Elision
of the <i>e</i> of the Particle <i>The</i> before Vowels: But it is requisite
likewise to take notice, that it sometimes loses its Vowel before a Word
that begins by a Consonant, and then its two remaining Letters are
joyn'd to the preceding Word; as <i>To th' Wall</i>, for <i>To the Wall</i>; <i>By
th' Wall</i>, for <i>By the Wall</i>, &amp;c. But this is scarce allowable in
Heroick Poetry.</p>

<p class="para2">The Particles <i>In</i>, <i>Of</i>, and <i>On</i>, sometimes lose their Consonants, and
are joyn'd to the Particle <i>The</i> in like manner; as <i>i'th'</i>, <i>o'th'</i>,
for <i>in the</i>, <i>of the</i>.</p>

<p class="para2">In some of our Poets we find the Pronoun <i>His</i> lose its two first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
Letters after any Word that ends in a Vowel; as <i>to's</i>, <i>by's</i>, &amp;c. for
<i>to his</i>, <i>by his</i>, &amp;c. Or after many Words that end in a Consonant,
after which the Letter S can be pronounc'd; as <i>In's</i>, <i>for's</i>, for <i>In
his</i>, <i>for his</i>, &amp;c. This is frequent in <i>Cowley</i>, who often takes too
great a Liberty in his Contractions; as <i>t' your</i> for <i>to your</i>, <i>t'
which</i> for <i>to which</i>, and many others; in which we must be cautious of
following his Example: But the contracting of the Pronoun <i>His</i> in the
manner I mention'd, is not wholly to be condemn'd.</p>

<p>We sometimes find the Word <i>Who</i>, contracted before Words that begin by
a Vowel; as,</p>

<p class="para2">
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>Wh' expose to Scorn and Hate both them and it.</i></span><span class="figright">Cowl.</span><br />
</p>

<p>And the Preposition <i>By</i> in like manner; as,</p>

<p class="para2">
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>B' unequal Fate, and Providence's Crime.</i></span><span class="figright">Dryd.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>Well did he know how Palms b' Oppression speed.</i></span><span class="figright">Cowl.</span><br />
</p>

<p>And the Pronouns personal, <i>He</i>, <i>She</i>, <i>They</i>, <i>We</i>; as,</p>

<p class="para2">
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>Timely h' obeys her wife Advice, and strait</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>To unjust Force sh' opposes just Deceit.</i></span><span class="figright">Cowl.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>Themselves at first against themselves th' excite.</i></span><span class="figright">Cowl.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>Shame and Woe to us, if w' our Wealth obey.</i></span><span class="figright">Cowl.</span><br />
</p>

<p class="para2">But these and the like Contractions are very rare in our most correct
Poets, and ought indeed wholly to be avoided: For 'tis a general Rule,
that no Vowel can be cut off before another, when it cannot be sunk in
the pronunciation of it: And therefore we ought to take care never to
place a Word that begins by a Vowel, after a Word that ends in one (mute
E only excepted) unless the final Vowel of the former can be lost in its
Pronunciation: For, to leave two Vowels opening on each other, causes a
very disagreeable <i>Hiatus</i>. Whenever therefore a Vowel ends a Word, the
next ought to begin with a Consonant, or what is Equivalent to it; as
our W, and H aspirate, plainly are.</p>

<p>For which reason 'tis a Fault in some of our Poets to cut off the <i>e</i> of
the Particle <i>The</i>, for Example, before a Word that begins by an H
aspirate; as</p>

<p class="para2">
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>And th' hasty Troops march'd loud and chearful down.</i></span><span class="figright">Cowl.</span><br />
</p>

<p>But if the H aspirate be follow'd by another E, that of the Particle
<i>The</i> may be cut off; As,</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>Th' Heroick Prince's Courage or his Love.</i></span><span class="figright">Wall.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>Th'</i> Hesperian <i>Fruit, and made the Dragon sleep.</i></span><span class="figright">Wall.</span><br />

<h2><a name="CHAP_II" id="CHAP_II"></a>CHAP. II.</h2>

<p class="center"><i>Of Rhyme.</i></p>

<hr style="width: 100%;" />
<h3>SECT. I.</h3>

<p class="center2"><i>What Rhyme is, and the several Sorts of it.</i></p>

<p class="para2">Rhyme is a Likeness or Uniformity of Sound in the terminations of two
Words, I say, of Sound, not of Letters; for the Office of Rhyme being to
content and please the Ear, and not the Eye, the Sound only is to be
regarded, not the Writing: Thus <i>Maid</i> and <i>Perswade</i>, <i>Laugh</i> and
<i>Quaff</i>, tho' they differ in Writing, rhyme very well: But <i>Plough</i> and
<i>Cough</i>, tho' written alike, rhyme not at all.</p>

<p class="para2">In our Versification we may observe 3 several sorts of Rhyme; Single,
Double, and Treble.</p>

<p class="para2">The single Rhyme is of two sorts: One of the Words that are accented on
the last Syllable: Another, of those that have their Accent on the last
save two.</p>

<p>The Words accented on the last Syllable, if they end in a Consonant, or
mute E, oblige the Rhyme to begin at the vowel that precedes their last
Consonant, and to continue to the end of the Word: In a Consonant; as,</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>Here might be seen that Beauty, Wealth, and Wit,</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>And Prowess, to the Pow'r of Love submit.</i></span><span class="figright">Dryd.</span><br />
</p>

<p>In mute E; as,</p>

<p class="para2">
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>A Spark of Virtue by the deepest Shade</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>Of sad Adversity, is fairer made.</i></span><span class="figright">Wall.</span><br />
</p>

<p>But if a Diphthong precede the last Consonant, the Rhyme must begin at
that Vowel of it whose Sound most prevails; as,</p>

<p class="para2">
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>Next to the Pow'r of waking Tempests cease,</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>Was in that Storm to have so calm a Peace.</i></span><span class="figright"> Wall.</span><br />
</p>

<p>If the Words accented on the last Syllable end in any of the Vowels
except mute E, or in a Diphthong, the Rhyme is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span> made only to that Vowel
or Diphthong. To the Vowel; as</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>So wing'd with Praise we penetrate the Sky,</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>Teach Clouds and Stars to praise him as we fly.</i></span><span class="figright">Wall.</span><br />
</p>

<p>To the Diphthong; as,</p>

<p class="para2">
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>So hungry Wolves, tho' greedy of their Prey,</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>Stop when they find a Lion in the way.</i></span><span class="figright">Wall.</span><br />
</p>

<p>The other sort of single Rhyme is of the Words that have their Accent on
the last Syllable save two. And these rhyme to the other in the same
manner as the former; that is to say, if they end in any of the Vowels,
except mute E, the Rhyme is made only to that Vowel; as,</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>So seems to speak the youthful Deity;</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>Voice, Colour, Hair, and all like</i> Mercury.</span><span class="figright">Wall.</span><br />
</p>

<p>But if they end in a Consonant or mute E, the Rhyme must begin at the
Vowel that precedes that Consonant, and continue to the end of the Word.
As has been shewn by the former Examples.</p>

<p>But we must take notice, that all the Words that are accented on the
last save two, will rhyme, not only to one another, but also to all the
Words whose Terminations have the same Sound, tho' they are accented on
the last Syllable. Thus <i>Tenderness</i> rhymes not only to <i>Poetess</i>,
<i>Wretchedness</i>, and the like, that are accented on the last save two,
but also to <i>Confess</i>, <i>Excess</i>, &amp;c. that are accented on the last; as,</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>Thou art my Father now, these Words confess,</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>That Same, and that indulgent Tenderness.</i></span><span class="figright">Dryd.</span><br />
</p>


<hr style="width: 100%;" />
<h3>SECT. II.</h3>

<p class="center2"><i>Of Double and Treble Rhyme.</i></p>

<p>All Words that are accented on the last save one, require the Rhyme to
begin at the Vowel of that Syllable, and to continue to the end of the
Word; and this is what we call Double Rhyme; as,</p>

<p class="para2">
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>Then all for Women, Painting, Rhyming, Drinking,</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>Besides ten Thousand Freaks that dy'd in Thinking.</i></span><span class="figright">Dryd.</span><br />
</p>

<p>But it is convenient to take notice, that the ancient Poets did not
always observe this Rule, and took care only that the last Syllables of
the Words should be alike in Sound, without any regard to the Seat of
the Accent. Thus <i>Nation</i> and <i>Affection</i>, <i>Tenderness</i> and <i>Hapless</i>,
<i>Villany</i> and <i>Gentry</i>, <i>Follow</i> and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span> <i>Willow</i>, and the like, were
allow'd as Rhymes to each other in the Days of <i>Chaucer</i>, <i>Spencer</i>, and
the rest of the Antients; but this is now become a fault in our
Versification; and these two Verses of <i>Cowley</i> rhyme not at all.</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>A clear and lively brown was</i> Merab's <i>Dye;</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>Such as the proudest Colours might envy.</i></span><br />
</p>

<p>Nor these of <i>Dryden</i>.</p>

<p class="para2">
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>Thus Air was void of Light, and Earth unstable,</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>And Waters dark Abyss unnavigable.</i></span><br />
</p>

<p class="para2">Because we may not place an Accent on the last Syllable of <i>Envy</i>, nor
on the last save one of <i>unnavigable</i>; which nevertheless we must be
oblig'd to do, if we make the first of them rhyme to <i>Dye</i>, the last to
<i>Unstable</i>.</p>

<p>But we may that observe in Burlesque Poetry, it is permitted to place an
Accent upon a Syllable that naturally has none; as,</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>When Pulpit, Drum Ecclesiastick,</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>Was beat with Fist instead of a Stick.</i></span><br />
</p>

<p>Where unless we pronounce the Particle A with a strong Accent upon it,
and make it sound like the Vowel <i>a</i> in the last Syllable but one of
<i>Ecclesiastick</i>, the Verse will lose all its Beauty and Rhyme. But this
is allowable in Burlesque Poetry only.</p>

<p>Observe that these double Rhymes may be compos'd of two several Words;
provided the Accent be on the last Syllable of the first of them; as in
these Verses of <i>Cowley</i>, speaking of Gold;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>A Curse on him who did refine it,</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>A Curse on him who first did coin it.</i></span><br />
</p>

<p>Or some of the Verses may end in an entire word, and the Rhyme to it be
compos'd of several; as,</p>

<p class="para2">
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>Tho' stor'd with Deletery Med'cines,</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>Which whosoever took is dead since.</i></span><span class="figright">Hud.</span><br />
</p>

<p>The Treble Rhyme is, when in words accented on the last save two we
begin the Rhyme at the Vowel of that Syllable, and continue it to the
end of the word: Thus <i>Charity</i> and <i>Parity</i>, <i>Tenderness</i> and
<i>Slenderness</i>, &amp;c., are treble Rhymes. And these too, as well as the
double, may be compos'd of several words; as,</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>There was an ancient sage Philosopher,</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>That had read</i> Alexander Ross <i>over.</i></span><span class="figright">Hud.</span><br />
</p>

<p>The Treble Rhyme is very seldom us'd, and ought wholly to be excluded
from serious Subjects; for it has a certain flatness,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span> unworthy the
Gravity requir'd in Heroick Verse. In which <i>Dryden</i> was of Opinion that
even the double Rhymes ought very cautiously to find place; and in all
his Translation of <i>Virgil</i>, he has made use of none except only in such
words as admit of a Contraction, and therefore cannot properly be said
to be double Rhymes; as <i>Giv'n</i>, <i>Driv'n</i>, <i>Tow'r</i>, <i>Pow'r</i>, and the
like. And indeed, considering their Measure is different from that of an
Heroick Verse, which consists but of 10 Syllables, they ought not to be
too frequently us'd in Heroick Poems; but they are very graceful in the
Lyrick, to which, as well as to the Burlesque, those Rhymes more
properly belong.</p>


<hr style="width: 100%;" />
<h3>SECT. III.</h3>

<p class="center2"><i>Further Instructions concerning Rhyme.</i></p>

<p>The Consonants, that precede the Vowels where the Rhyme begins, must be
different in Sound, and not the same; for then the Rhyme will be too
perfect; as <i>Light</i>, <i>Delight</i>; <i>Vice</i>, <i>Advice</i>, and the like; for tho'
such Rhymes were allowable in the Days of <i>Spencer</i> and the other old
Poets, they are not so now; nor can there be any Musick in one single
Note. <i>Cowley</i> himself owns, that they ought not to be employed except
in Pindarick Odes, which is a sort of free Poetry, and there too very
sparingly, and not without a third Rhyme to answer to both; as,</p>



<div class="floatright" style="width: 20px;">
<img src="images/newbrace3.png" width="20" height="52" alt="" title="" />
</div>
<p><span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>In barren Age wild and inglorious lye,</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;"><i>And boast of past Fertility,</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>The poor Relief of present Poverty.</i></span><span class="right">Cowl.</span>
</p>

<p class="para2">Where the words <i>Fertility</i> and <i>Poverty</i> rhyme very well to the last
word of the first Verse, <i>Lye</i>; but cannot rhyme to each other, because
the Consonants that precede the last Vowels are the same, both in
Writing and Sound.</p>

<p>But this is yet less allowable if the Accent be on the Syllable of the
Rhyme; as,</p>

<p class="para2">
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>Her Language melts Omnipotence, arrests</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>His Hand, and thence the vengeful Lightning wrests.</i></span><span class="figright">Blac.</span><br />
</p>

<p>From hence it follows that a word cannot rhyme to it self, tho' the
signification be different; as <i>He Leaves</i> to <i>the Leaves</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Nor the words that differ both in Writing and Sense, if they have the
same Sound, as <i>Maid</i> and <i>Made</i>, <i>Prey</i> and <i>Pray</i>, <i>to Bow</i> and <i>a
Bough</i>: as,</p>

<p class="para2">
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>How gawdy Fate may be in Presents</i> sent,</span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>And creep insensibly by Touch or</i> Scent.</span><span class="figright">Oldh.</span><br />
</p>

<p class="para2">Nor a Compound to its Simple; as <i>Move</i> to <i>Remove</i>, <i>Taught</i> to
<i>Untaught</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p class="para2">Nor the Compounds of the same Words to one another, as <i>Disprove</i> to
<i>Approve</i>, and the like. All which proceeds from what I said before,
<i>viz.</i> That the Consonants that precede the Vowel where the Rhyme
begins, must not be the same in Sound, but different. In all which we
vary from our Neighbours; for neither the <i>French</i>, <i>Italians</i> not
<i>Spaniards</i> will allow that a Rhyme can be too perfect: And we meet with
frequent Examples in their Poetry, where not only the Compounds rhyme to
their Simples, and to themselves; but even where words written and
pronounc'd exactly alike, provided they have a different Signification,
are made use of as Rhymes to one another: But this is not permitted in
our Poetry; and therefore, tho' in the two former Editions of this Book
I said that <i>Rhyme is only a Sameness of Sound at the End of Words</i>, I
have in this given it a Definition which I take to be more agreeable to
our Practice, and call'd it <i>a Likeness or Uniformity of Sound in the
Terminations of two Words</i>.</p>

<p>We must take care not to place a Word at the middle of a Verse that
rhymes to the last Word of it; as,</p>

<p class="para2">
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>So young in show, as if he still should grow.</i></span><br />
</p>

<p>But this fault is still more inexcusable, if the second Verse rhyme to
the middle and end of the first; as,</p>

<p class="para2">
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>Knowledge he only sought, and so soon caught,</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>As if for him Knowledge had rather sought.</i></span><span class="figright">Cowl.</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>Here Passion sways; but there the Muse shall raise</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>Eternal Monuments of louder Praise.</i>Wall.</span><br />
</p>

<p>Or both the middle and end of the second to the last Word of the first;
as,</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>Farewell, she cry'd, my Sister, thou dear Part,</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>Thou sweetest part of my divided Heart.</i></span><span class="figright">Dryd.</span><br />

<p class="center"><i>Of the several sorts of Poems, or Compositions in Verse.</i></p>

<p>All our Poems may be divided into two sorts; the first of those that are

consisting of several Verses.</p>


<hr style="width: 100%;" />
<h3>SECT. I.</h3>

<p class="center2"><i>Of the Poems compos'd in Couplets.</i></p>

<p class="para2">In the Poems compos'd in Couplets, the Rhymes follow one another, and
end at each Couplet; that is to say, the 2d Verse rhymes to the 1st, the
4th to the 3d, the 6th to the 5th, and in like manner to the end of the
Poem.</p>

<p>The Verses employ'd in this sort of Poems, are either Verses of 10
Syllables; as,</p>

<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>Not in your Race, but in your Eyes.</i></span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>Pleasures shorter than the Day?</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>Could we, which we never can,</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>Stretch our lives beyond their Span.</i></span><br />

<h3>SECT. II.</h3>

<p class="center2"><i>Of the Poems compos'd in Stanzas: And first, of the Stanzas consisting
of three, and of four Verses.</i></p>

<p class="para2">In the Poems composed in Stanzas, each Stanza contains a certain number
of Verses consisting for the most part of a different number of
Syllables: And a Poem that consists of several Stanzas, we generally
call an Ode; and this is Lyrick Poetry.</p>

<p class="para2">But we must not forget to observe that our Antient Poets frequently made
use of intermixed Rhyme in their Heroick Poems, which they dispos'd into
Stanzas and Cantos. Thus the <i>Troilus</i> and <i>Cressida</i> of <i>Chaucer</i> is
compos'd in Stanzas consisting of 7 Verses; the <i>Fairy Queen</i> of
<i>Spencer</i> in Stanzas of 9, <i>&amp;c.</i> And this they took from <i>Italians</i>,
whose Heroick Poems generally consist in Stanzas of 8. But this is now
wholly laid aside, and <i>Davenant</i>, who compos'd his <i>Gondibert</i> in
Stanzas of Verses in alternate Rhyme, was the last that followed their
Example of intermingling Rhymes in Heroick Poems.</p>

<p class="para2">The Stanzas employ'd in our Poetry, cannot consist of less than three,
and are seldom of more than 12 Verses, except in Pindarick Odes, where
the Stanzas are different from one another in number of Verses, as shall
be shewn.</p>

<p>But to treat of all the different Stanzas that are employ'd or may be
admitted in our Poetry, would be a labour no less tedious than useless;
it being easie to demonstrate, that they may be vary'd almost to an
Infinity, that would be different from one another, either in the Number
of the Verses of each Stanza, or in the Number of the Syllables of each
Verse; or lastly, in the various intermingling of the Rhyme. I shall
therefore confine my self to mention only such as are most frequently
us'd by the best of our modern Poets. And first of the Stanzas
consisting of three Verses.</p>

<p>In the Stanzas of three Verses, or Triplets, the Verses of each Stanza<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
rhyme to one another; and are either Heroick; as,</p>

<div class="floatright" style="width: 20px;">
<img src="images/newbrace3.png" width="20" height="52" alt="" title="" />
</div>
<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>Nothing, thou Elder Brother e'en to shade!</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>Thou hadst a Being e'er the World was made.</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>And, (well-fix'd) art alone of ending not afraid.</i></span><span class="right">Roch.</span><br />
</p>

<p>Or else they consist of 8 Syllables; as these of <i>Waller</i>, <i>Of a fair
Lady playing with a Snake</i>.</p>

<div class="floatright" style="width: 20px;">
<img src="images/newbrace3.png" width="20" height="52" alt="" title="" />
</div>
<p class="para2">
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>Strange that such Horrour and such Grace</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>Should dwell together in one Place,</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>A Fury's Arm, an Angel's Face,</i></span><br />
</p>

<p>Nor do the Verses of these Stanzas always contain a like number of
Syllables; for the first and third may have ten, the second but eight;
as,</p>

<div class="floatright" style="width: 20px;">
<img src="images/newbrace3.png" width="20" height="52" alt="" title="" />
</div>
<p class="para2">
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>Men without Love have oft so cunning grown</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;"><i>That something like it they have shewn,</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>But none who had it, ev'r seem'd to have none.</i></span><br />
<span class="floatright2" style="width: 20px;">

</p>

<p class="para2">In the Stanzas of 4 Verses, the Rhyme may be intermix'd in two different
manners; for either the 1st and 3d Verse may rhyme to each other, and by
consequence the 2d and 4th, and this is call'd Alternate Rhyme; or the
1st and 4th may rhyme, and by consequence the 2d and 3d.</p>

<p>But there are some Poems in Stanzas of four Verses, where the Rhymes
follow one another, and the Verses differ in number of syllables only;
as in <i>Cowley's</i> Hymn to the Light, which begins thus,</p>

<p class="para2">
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>First born of</i> Chaos! <i>who so fair didst come</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;"><i>From the old Negro's darksom Womb:</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;"><i>Which, when it saw the lovely Child,</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>The melancholy Mass put on kind Looks and smil'd.</i></span><br />
</p>

<p>But these Stanzas are generally in Alternate Rhyme, and the Verses
consist either of 10 Syllables; as,</p>

<p class="para2">
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>She ne'er saw Courts, but Courts could have undone</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;"><i>With untaught Looks and an unpractis'd Heart:</i></span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 3em;"><i>And very Minutes Hours are grown.</i></span><span class="figright">Cowl.</span><br />
</p>

<p>Or of 8 and 6 in the like manner; as,</p>

<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>Then ask not Bodies doom'd to dye,</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;"><i>To what Abode they go;</i></span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 3em;"><i>'Tis better not to know.</i></span><span class="figright">Dav.</span><br />
</p>

<p>Or of 7; as,</p>

</p>

<p><i>Note</i>, That it is absolutely necessary that both the Construction and
Sense should end with the Stanza, and not fall into the beginning of the
following one, as it does in the last Example, which is a fault wholly
to be avoided.</p>


<hr style="width: 100%;" />
<h3>SECT. III.</h3>

<p class="center2"><i>Of the Stanzas of Six Verses.</i></p>

<p>The Stanzas of 6 Verses, are generally only one of the before-mention'd
Quadrans or Stanzas of 4 Verses, with two Verses at the end that rhyme
to one another; as,</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>A Rural Judge dispos'd of Beautie's Prize</i>,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;"><i>A simple Shepherd was prefer'd to</i> Jove;</span><br />

</p>

<p class="para2">Where the 4 first Verses are only a Quadran, and consist of 10 Syllables
each in Alternate Rhyme.</p>

<p>The following Stanza in like manner is compos'd of a Quadran, whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
Verses consist of 8 Syllables; and to which 2 Verses that rhyme to one
another are added at the end; as,</p>

<p class="para2">
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>Hope waits upon the flowry Prime</i>,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;"><i>And Summer, tho' it be less gay</i>,</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>All that was promised by the Spring.</i></span><span class="figright">Wall.</span><br />
</p>

<p>Sometimes the Quadran ends the Stanza; and the two Lines of the same
Rhyme begin it; as,</p>

<p class="para2">
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>Here's to thee</i>, Dick, <i>this whining Love despise:</i></span><br />

<h3>SECT. IV.</h3>

<p class="center2"><i>Of the Stanzas of 8 Verses.</i></p>

<p>I have already said, that the <i>Italians</i> compose their Heroick Poems in
Stanzas of 8 Verses, where the Rhyme is dispos'd as follows; the 1st,
2d, and 5th Verses rhyme to one another, and the 2d, 4th, and 6th, the
two last always rhyme to each other. Now our Translators of their
Heroick Poems have observ'd the same Stanza and Disposition of Rhyme; of
which take the following Example from <i>Fairfax's</i> Translation of
<i>Tasso's Goffredo</i>, <i>Cant.</i> 1. <i>Stan.</i> 3d.</p>

<p class="para2">
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>Thither thou know'st the World is best inclin'd,</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;"><i>Where luring</i> Parnass <i>most his Beams imparts;</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>And Truth convey'd in Verse of gentlest kind,</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;"><i>To read sometimes, will move the dullest Hearts;</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>So we, if Children young diseas'd we find,</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;"><i>Anoint with Sweets the Vessel's foremost parts,</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>To make them taste the Potions sharp we give;</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>They drink deceiv'd, and so deceiv'd they live.</i></span><br />
</p>

<p>But our Poets seldom imploy this Stanza in Compositions of their own;
where the following Stanzas of 8 Verses are most frequent.</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 3em;"><i>Some others may with safety tell</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;"><i>The mod'rate Flames which in them dwell;</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;"><i>And either find some Med'cine there,</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;"><i>Or cure themselves ev'n by Despair:</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;"><i>My Love's so great, that it might prove</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;"><i>Dang'rous to tell her that I love.</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>So tender is my Wound, it cannot bear</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>Any Salute, tho' of the kindest Air.</i></span><span class="figright">Cowl.</span><br />
</p>

<p class="para2">Where the Rhymes follow one another, and the six first Verses consist of

<p>We have another sort of Stanza of 8 Verses, where the 4th rhymes to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
1st, the 3d to the ad, and the four last are two Couplets; and where the
1st, 4th, 6th and 8th, are of 10 Syllables each, the 4 others but of 8;
as,</p>

<p class="para2">
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>I've often wish'd to love: What shall I do?</i></span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 3em;"><i>And I a double Task must bear,</i></span><br />

<p class="center2"><i>Of the Stanzas of 10 and of 12 Verses.</i></p>

<p>The Stanzas of 10 and 12 Verses are seldom employed in our Poetry, it
being very difficult to confine our selves to a certain Disposition of
Rhyme, and measure of Verse, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span> so many Lines together; for which
Reason those of 4, 6, and 8 Verses are the most frequent. However we
sometimes find some of 10 and 12; as in <i>Cowley's</i> Ode which he calls
<i>Verses left upon a Wager</i>, where the Rhymes follow one another, but the
Verses differ in Number of Syllables.</p>

<p class="para2">
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>As seen hereafter will I Wagers lay</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;"><i>'Gainst what an Oracle shall say:</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;"><i>Fool that I was to venture to deny</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;"><i>A Tongue so us'd to Victory.</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>A Tongue so blest by Nature and by Art,</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>That never yet it spoke, but gain'd a Heart.</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;"><i>Tho' what you said had not been true,</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;"><i>If spoke by any else but you;</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;"><i>Your Speech will govern Destiny,</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;"><i>And Fate will change, rather than you shall lye.</i></span><span class="figright">Cowl.</span><br />
</p>

<p>The same Poet furnishes us with an Example of a Stanza of 12 Verses in
the Ode he calls the <i>The Prophet</i>, where the Rhymes are observ'd in the
same manner as in the former Example.</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>Teach me to Love! Go teach thy self more Wit:</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;"><i>I chief Professor am of it.</i></span><br />

<p class="para2">We have also Stanzas that consist of odd numbers of Verses, as of 5, 7,
9, and 11; in all which it of necessity follows, that three Verses of
the Stanza rhyme to one another, or that one of them be a blank Verse.</p>

<p>In the Stanzas of 5 Verses, the 1st and 3d may rhyme, and the 2d and two
last; as,</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>Sees not my Love how Time resumes</i></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span><br />

<p>See also an Instance of a Stanza of 5 Verses where the Rhymes are
intermix'd in the same manner as the former, but the 1st and 3d Verses
are composed but of 4 Syllables each.</p>

<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>Think that already lost which than must never gain.</i></span><span class="figright">Cowl.</span><br />
</p>

<p>The Stanzas of 7 Verses are frequent enough in our Poetry, especially
among the Ancients, who compos'd many of their Poems in this sort of
Stanza: See an Example of one of them taken from <i>Spencer</i> in <i>The
Ruines of Time</i>, where the 1st and 3d Verses rhyme to one another, the
2d, 4th and 5th, and the two last.</p>

<p class="para2">
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>But Fame with Golden Wings aloft doth fly</i></span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>And in sweet Poets Verse be glorify'd.</i></span><br />
</p>

<p class="para2">I have rather chosen to take notice of this Stanza, because that Poet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
and <i>Chaucer</i> have made use of it in many of their Poems, tho' they have
not been follow'd in it by any of the Moderns: whose Stanza's of 7
Verses are generally compos'd as follows.</p>

<p>Either the four first Verses are a Quadran in Alternate Rhyme, and the
three last rhyme to one another; as,</p>

<p class="para2">
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>Now by my Love, the greatest Oath that is,</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;"><i>None loves you half so well as I;</i></span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>But for Heaven's sake believe me, or I dye.</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;"><i>No Servant sure but did deserve</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>His Master should believe that he did serve;</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>And I'll ask no more Wages tho' I starve.</i></span><span class="figright">Cowl.</span><br />
</p>

<p>Or the four first are two Couplets, and the three last a Triplet; as,</p>

<p class="para2">
<span style="margin-left: 4em;"><i>Indeed I must confess</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;"><i>When Souls mix 'tis a Happiness,</i></span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 4em;"><i>Their Bodies too are plac'd.</i></span><span class="figright">Cowl.</span><br />
</p>

<p>Or, on the contrary, the three first may rhyme, and the four last be in
Rhymes that follow one another; as,</p>

<p class="para2">
<span style="margin-left: 3em;"><i>From Hate, Fear, Hope, Anger, and Envy free,</i></span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>That I have no Disease besides the Plague.</i></span><span class="figright">Cowl.</span><br />
</p>

<p>Or the 1st may rhyme to the two last, the 2d to the 5th, and the 3d and
4th to one another; as,</p>

<p class="para2">
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>In vain thou drowsie God I thee invoke,</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;"><i>For thou who dost from Fumes arise,</i></span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 3em;"><i>With a Thick Cloud by Vapours made,</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;"><i>Canst have no Pow'r to shut his Eyes,</i></span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>Whose Flame's so pure, that it sends up no smoke.</i></span><span class="figright">Cowl.</span><br />
</p>

<p>Or lastly, the four first and two last may be in following Rhyme, and
the 5th a Blank Verse; as,</p>

</p>

<p>The Stanzas of 9 and of 11 Syllables are not so frequent as those of 5
and of 7. <i>Spencer</i> has composed his <i>Fairy Queen</i> in Stanzas of 9
Verses, where the 1st rhymes to the 3d, the 2d to the 4th 5th and 7th;
and the 6th to the two last. But this Stanza is very difficult to
maintain, and the unlucky choice of it reduc'd him often to the
necessity of making use of many exploded Words; nor has he, I think,
been follow'd in it by any of the Moderns; whose 6 first Verses of the
Stanzas that consist of 9, are generally in Rhymes that follow one
another, and the three last a Triplet; as,</p>

<p class="para2">
<span style="margin-left: 3em;"><i>Beauty, Love's Scene and Masquerade,</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>So well by well-plac'd Lights, and Distance made;</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>False Coin! with which th' Impostor cheats us still,</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>The Stamp and Colour good, but Metal ill:</i></span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 3em;"><i>For tho' thy Being be but Show,</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>'Tis chiefly Night which Men to thee allow,</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>And chuse t' enjoy thee, when thou least art thou.</i></span><span class="figright">Cowl.</span><br />
</p>

<p>In the following Example the like Rhyme is observ'd, but the Verses
differ in Measure from the former.</p>

<p class="para2">
<span style="margin-left: 3em;"><i>Beneath this gloomy Shade,</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>By Nature only for my Sorrows made,</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;"><i>I'll spend this Voice in Cries;</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;"><i>In Tears I'll waste these Eyes,</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;"><i>By Love so vainly fed:</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>So Lust of old, the Deluge punished.</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;"><i>Ah wretched Youth! said I;</i></span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>Ah wretched Youth! the Fields and Floods reply.</i></span><span class="figright">Cowl.</span><br />

<p>The Stanzas consisting of 11 Verses are yet less frequent than those of
9, and have nothing particular to be observ'd in them. Take an Example
of one of them, where the 6 first are 3 Couplets, the three next a
Triplet, the two last a Couplet; and where the 4th, the 7th, and the
last Verses are of 10 Syllables each, the others of 8.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>No, to what purpose should I speak?</i></span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>She cannot love me if she would;</i></span><br />
<i>And, to say Truth, 'twere pity that she should.</i><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>No, to the Grave thy Sorrows bear,</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>As silent as they will be there:</i></span><br />
<i>Since that lov'd Hand this mortal Wound does give,</i><br />

<p>The Stanzas of Pindarick Odes are neither confin'd to a certain number

Syllables, others not above 4: Sometimes the Rhymes follow one another
for several Couplets together, sometimes they are remov'd 6 Verses from
each other; and all this in the same Stanza. <i>Cowley</i> was the first who
introduc'd this sort of Poetry into our Language: Nor can the nature of
it be better describ'd than as he himself has done it, in one of the

ago.</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
